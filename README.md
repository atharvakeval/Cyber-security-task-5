Task: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

What I Did:
1. Installed **Wireshark** on my system.
2. Started a live capture on my active network interface.
3. Opened a browser and visited a few websites to generate traffic.
4. Stopped the capture after around 1 minute.
5. Applied protocol filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP) to analyze packets.
6. Identified at least 3 different protocols from the capture.

. What I Learned:
- How Wireshark captures packets in real time.
- How to use filters to view specific protocol traffic.
- Difference between TCP and UDP traffic.
- Basics of interpreting packet details like source IP, destination IP, and port numbers.

### ðŸ›¡ Conclusion:
Wireshark is an essential tool for network troubleshooting and security analysis. It allows identifying communication patterns, diagnosing problems, and spotting suspicious activities.
